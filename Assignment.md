## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### 🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned

---

#### 1. Concept: Branching  
- **Expectation 👀**: I thought branching was mostly for huge collaborative teams or open-source projects.  
- **Reality 😅**: I learned that even solo developers should use branches to test features safely.  
- **Impact 💡**: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it into main after testing.

---

#### 2. Concept: Commit Messages  
- **Expectation 👀**: I thought I could write anything like “final update” or “done”.  
- **Reality 😅**: Using structured commit messages like `feat`, `fix`, `style`, etc., makes it easy to track progress.  
- **Impact 💡**: I used `feat` for new features and `fix` to fix form issues, which helped keep things organized.

---

#### 3. Concept: Pull Requests (PRs)  
- **Expectation 👀**: I thought PRs were only used in big teams.  
- **Reality 😅**: I saw how PRs help review and track changes even in small projects.  
- **Impact 💡**: I used PRs to merge my feature branches and even resolved merge conflicts manually.

---

#### 4. Concept: GitHub Projects  
- **Expectation 👀**: I assumed it was just a fancy to-do list.  
- **Reality 😅**: I discovered how powerful project boards are for tracking milestones, issues, and progress visually.  
- **Impact 💡**: I created a project board for each milestone, helping me stay organized from start to finish.
